# Add magic links to 2FA emails

Date: 2024-04-11

## Status

**DRAFT**.

_VALUES: (DRAFT, IN REVIEW, APPROVED, REJECTED)_

## Context

Notify requires users to manually copy two factor authentication codes from their email then paste it into a text box on the site in order to log into Notify. This process is cumbersome and not that accessible, or easy to use.

The aim of this initiative is to improve the accessibility and ease of use of Notify's login process.

## Options

### Increase the visibility of 2FA codes in emails
The simplest approach is to increase the visiblility of codes in the email to make the code more obvious and easier to interact with:
- Place the code on it's own line in the email
- Bold or otherwise highlight the next
- Increase font size

While increasing visibility is an improvement, it does not address the cumbersome amount of actions needed to complete the login:

```

### Use magic links
By using a magic link that the user can simply click on to complete the login process, we reduce the number of manual interactions required by the user to log in, thus making the process less obstructive and feel more natural.
