# Archive `document-download-frontend`

Date: 2021-10-20

## Status

**DRAFT**

## Context

The `document-download-frontend` web server is a part of Notify that is used when sending a link to a file. In GovUK's Notify it is a site where end users are directed to, and where they may then download the file they were sent. In https://github.com/cds-snc/notification-document-download-frontend/pull/52 we changed the frontend to simply redirect the user on to get the file from `document-download-api`.

If instead of this redirect we simply send the `document-download-api` link to the end user we can remove `document-download-frontend` from Notify. This will reduce the number of web servers we run and maintain from 4 down to 3 (admin, api, and document-download-api) which will reduce maintenance requirements as well as improve our security posture.

## Considerations

1. If we ever want to bring back document-download-frontend there will be work required to patch new security vulnerabilities and re-integrate into Notify.

## Potential Solutions

As mentioned, we can have the end user email contain the link to `document-download-api`. This approach has been examined in https://github.com/cds-snc/notification-api/pull/1382.

## Decision

TBD
