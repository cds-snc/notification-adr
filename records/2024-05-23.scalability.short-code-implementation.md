# Short Code Implementation

Date: 2025-05-23

## Status

**DRAFT**.

## Context

Notify was awarded a General Purpose Short Code by the Canadian Telecom Regulators. This ADR goes through when an SMS will be sent through a Short Code or Long Code and the decision behind why a certain method will be chosen.

## Implementation Goals
1. Assign SMS templates to send through our generic shortcode.
1. Assign any template to high, normal, or bulk priority automatically (SMS & Email)
1. Design a way to categorize templates
1. Override to force a certain template to go through a certain flow
1. The ability for users to select “Other” and enter their own use case for Template Categories

## Goals to be addressed by another ADR
1. Figure out dynamic and static pools of numbers
1. Decide on using AWS Pinpoint or AWS SNS
Usage of a pool of codes/ dedicated long codes

## Current Context and Assumptions

1. **We assume that ALL Priority Messages will be sent using the Short Code**
1. For the purposes of this ADR, assume SMSs are sent to a send_sms client call. Under the hood the send_sms call might utilize SMS or Pinpoint.
1. Currently, we have 3 priority queues - HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW. Given a template, your message will reach within a certain SLO if sent through a certain queue
1. A template can be of type PRIORITY, NORMAL, and BULK which ***currently*** maps directly to the HIGH, MEDIUM, and LOW queues. 
1. The templates refer to both SMS and Email templates, but for shortcodes, this ADR focuses on SMS use cases

# Implementation

## Template Categorization

When a client creates a template we want to be able to Categorize it into a certain type of template. We will start with the following Template Categories that were created through research on Notify's current templates.

| Template Category | Example  |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Status Update | Notice of change in status<br>The progress of a submission |
| <br>Promotional call to action | Surveys<br>General apply now<br>"Learn more" |
| Service-related requests | Submit additional documents<br>Follow up to move a process forward |
| Fulfillment with attachments - email only | "Here’s your permit" |
| <br>Broadcast messages | General information - (not related to transactions such as COVID-19 information)<br>Newsletters<br>Status updates |
| <br>Auto-reply | No-reply messages<br>Acknowledgments<br>Response wait times |
| Verification message | Authentication codes <br>Confirmation of account changes |
| Confirmation / Receipts | Record of transactions<br>Approvals |
| Other | User defined |

### Determining Template Priority
A new table will be added to the DB for TemplateCategories. The primary key from TemplateCategories will be a foreign key to the Templates Table. All TemplateCategories will be assigned a pre-computed priority.

<!-- ![Potential ERD](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cds-snc/notification-adr/records/diagrams/2024-05-23.scalability.short-code-implementation/ERD.jpg?raw=true "Potential ERD") -->

![Potential ERD](../records/diagrams/2024-05-23.scalability.short-code-implementation/ERD.jpg?raw=true "Potential ERD")

```
process_type is (bulk, normal, priority)
```

Given the new TemplateCategories, each template will default to a process_type that is set in TemplateCategory. To create manual overrides, an Admin will edit the process_type on the Templates Table. For this to work, we have two options:
1. Create a new column in Templates `new_process_type`
2. Clear the current process_type in the Templates table to be empty.

After the above is implemented,
```
Notification Priority = Template.new_process_type else TemplateCategory.process_type
```
For most Templates, the Template.process_type/new_process_type will be empty. Only if overridden by Admin, will that field have information.

**Use case:**  
An SMS Template is of type "XYZ" that is of "low" priority. The client reaches out to us about the importance of the messages being sent immediately. We leave the category of the Template as "XYZ", but manually update the Template to "high" priority. This means that the message will be sent using the short-code.


### Other Template Category

Option 1:  
Let client's manually add a Category for their template, if it doesn't fit in the above usecase. A ticket is created in Freshdesk for this new Template Category. A decision is made about adding a new Category, support can add that Category through an Admin workflow page (similar to Branding).

Option 2:  
Client adds a new Category. We run a classifier to the Templates and determine whether it should be a new Category, or live within the existing Categories (supervised learning). Depending on the decision, a new entry is made in the TemplateCategory table.

Regardless of which option we choose, there is a time when the Category for a Template is undetermined. During this time, we will default the process_type of that Template to a Generic "Low Category (Bulk)" for all of our workflows to stay the same.

#### Example
There is a process_type in TemplateCategories and process_type in Templates.

1. If a client chooses a category, the process_type in Templates will be empty.
1. If the client chooses "Other" - while we are determining what TemplateCategory the Template must have, it will default to "Low".
1. If an Admin wants to override the process_type for a given Template, that process_type will be overwritten in the Templates table.


## Existing Templates

In order to categorize existing templates, an offline classifier will be used. Currently Notify Production has 12600 existing templates. There are couple of methods that might be used to classify these templates. The size of the data file is not large, and we can assume that classification might be run locally.

1. Classical Machine Learning Techniques - Naive Bayes, Linear Regression or Random Forest.  
   We can create a test data set of around 100 templates, and use that to run any of the above models.

1. Leverage GENAI  
   We can send the data file to a few of the LLM models and run a classifier accordingly. One thing to note is if there are any privacy considerations in sending Template data to a hosted LLM model. 

1. Local LLM Model  
   Instead of sending template data to a hosted LLM model, we can run LLama locally and instead use that to help with our classficiation.
