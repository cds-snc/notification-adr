# Enforcing priority lanes

Date: 2022-03-08

## Status

**DRAFT.**

## Context

Listing contextual elements to consider prior to offer suggestions and deepen our understanding of current limitations on priority lanes in GCNotify.

### Redis queues

In order to buffer up notifications between the API and the celery tasks, GCNotify currently keeps these in two Redis queues: one for SMS and one for emails. In Redis land, batches of notifications are taken out in the order these were received. This means high priority notifications might have to wait behind a large number of bulk notifications.

## Current notification pipeline flow

We store all notifications that come throught the API into Redis queues, one for each notification types (SMS and emails). A celery beat worker process notifications from the queues at a chunk size of 10 (at moment of this writing). Each list get processed as a single unit and gets saved to the Database. Instead of saving a single notification at a time, we are now saving a list of notifications (batch) in a single transacation.

### The database-tasks SQS queue

Database operations are all sent through the database-tasks queue/worker. This has a benefit of lining up and tracking a batch of operations to reduce the load. A major downside is that this is a bottleneck for high priority database operations such as saving a notification that needs to be sent in the next seconds. There are use cases when GCNotify is constantly hit and the database-tasks queue grows bigger. There are no FIFO strategy set on this queue as we are targeting high volume processing. This means though that no priority distinction is possible for operations going through it.

## Priority Queues

Here is an aggregate for the amount of notifications sent using a priority template:

| Date    | Count |
| :---        | :----   |
| 2022-03-14   | 3976     |
| 2022-03-15   | 4694      |
| 2022-03-16   | 4539     |
| 2022-03-17  | 4418     |
| 2022-03-18   | 4302     |
| 2022-03-19  | 3314     |
| 2022-03-20  | 3271     |
| 2022-03-21  | 3762     |

The above data was taken into consideration while designing a system that will work for priority notifications.

## Requirements

1. We need to process to priority notifications at a faster pace than normal and bulk notifications.
2. We need to process to normal notifications at a faster pace than bulk notifications.
3. We should preserve the batch saving [workflow](https://github.com/cds-snc/notification-adr/blob/main/records/2021-09-27.batch-celery-save.md) in order to keep the scalable properies of that work.

## Options

Listed in this section are different options available to us to improve our priority lanes.

1. ### Improving Redis inboxes

   We would add new Redis queues to replicate the same priorities that email sending has: priority and bulk queues. By setting up different Redis queues, we can discriminate in a favorable or unfavorable way the notifications depending on the queue these sit in.

2. ### Specific Beat Functions

   The current beat functions have a cadence of 10 seconds. We can have beat workers scheduled at a faster cadence for higher priority notifications. For example, bulk can be scheduled at 10 seconds, normal at 5 seconds and high priority every second.

3. ### Improve Queuing

   We currently send all notifications to the database queue. We can split the priority/normal/bulk notifications to be sent to corresponding priority queue. We will have to create SQS queues to and forward the notifications to corresponding priority queue.

## Things to Consider

We will be setting up the exact same pipeline that we currently have for notifications, just with a higher cadence for delivery.

We have a low number of priority notifications at current time sent through out the day, so using a FIFO queue might not be the high priority of upcoming changes given their current low volume.

## Consequences & Results
