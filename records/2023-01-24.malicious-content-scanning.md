# Malicious Content Scanning

Date: 2023-01-24

## Status

**DRAFT**.

_VALUES: (DRAFT, IN REVIEW, APPROVED, REJECTED)_

## Context

We are working on detecting malicious content in attached files, as described in [this issue card](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/notify-planning-614b3ad91bc2030015ed22f5/issues/gh/cds-snc/notification-planning/725). This is part of a larger effort to detect realtime misuse of Notify, which was a recommendation from a recent security audit.

The SRE team has created the [scan-files](https://github.com/cds-snc/scan-files) project, which is a tool to help platform products scan files for malicious content. It includes terraform for [S3 scan object](https://github.com/cds-snc/scan-files/tree/main/module/s3-scan-object), which is sets up a lambda function that watches a given S3 bucket and scans each new file. The scan verdict is then written as a tag to the S3 object, and can be read when the S3 object is accessed.

We have [tried getting the S3 scan object lambda function to run on our S3 bucket](https://github.com/cds-snc/notification-terraform/pull/600), but that did not work because we are using a different encryption key for each file in S3. This is because our S3 bucket for file uploads is public, and we need to prevent a user from being able to download and decrypt files they should not have access to.

We are now calling the scan-files api directly from the Document Download API ((Draft PR)[https://github.com/cds-snc/notification-document-download-api/pull/97]). This API can take a few seconds to return a response, and this time increases as file size increases. So we need to stop this from causing delaying the response when a user makes a requests to the Notify API.  

We have explored using the `asyncio` library in python to create a new process to call the scan-files api (here)[https://github.com/cds-snc/notification-document-download-api/pull/97/files#diff-a842b15bd72bea41437e64bda92d12262c8eca35af7e8adf111bd520fe7c3010R1]. Then once the result is returned, we could write that result to the S3 object as a tag which can be read later. However, this approach did not work to reduce the response time for the Document Download API.

It seems that it is [not possible to create background processes inside flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/async-await/#background-tasks).

## Options

Here are some of the options for scanning email attachments with the scan-files project.

### Migrate Document Download API from Flask to Quart

Flask does not have good async support, and [they suggest using Quart for better async support](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/async-await/#when-to-use-quart-instead). 

It does seem like Quart [adds support for background tasks](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/how_to_guides/background_tasks.html) and would solve our problem.

It seems like migrating from Flask to [Quart](https://github.com/pallets/quart) is not very difficult (see [quart docs](https://quart.palletsprojects.com/en/latest/how_to_guides/flask_migration.html)).

### Duplicate S3 bucket

The scan-files project comes with a terraform module that triggers a scan of newly created S3 objects in a bucket it is told to watch. The publicly accessible S3 bucket we are currently using to store file attachments won't work, since it these file are each encrypted with a unique key and scan-files tf module doens not support this. But we could create a duplicate s3 bucket that is not publicly available containing unencrypted versions of these files.

That would work but we would need to be able to map files from the public s3 bucket to the private bucket, and we would need to enforce the same retention/deletion policies on both buckets.

### Implement a new queue in Document Download API to start background tasks

Use celery to store a queue of tasks to query the scan-files API and add a tag with the scan verdict to the S3 object.

### Create a new api/lambda function to perform the task 

Another possibility?
