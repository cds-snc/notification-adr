# Reshaping our CI/CD environments

Date: 2024-01-22

## Status

**DRAFT**.

## Context

A new *development* environment has been created with recent effort around
business continuity plan (BCP)<sup>[1]</sup>. It was created from scratch
with the goal of determining how much effort and time it takes to recreate
a whole GCNotify environment from scratch. Since then, the team used this
environment to experiment on new infrastructure changes in an isolated manner,
increasing velocity with changes of this nature.

This also comes at a time when there is a desire to increase automation of the
release process among the team, potentially improving the release process and
decreasing the time spent on the ops lead routine tasks. This has to be done
with certain considerations in mind such as risk, testing, traceability,
rollback and accountability.

> <sup>[1]</sup> A business continuity plan (BCP) is a strategic playbook created to help an organization maintain or quickly resume business functions in the face of disruption, whether that disruption is caused by a natural disaster, civic unrest, cyberattack, or any other threat to business operations.

## Goals

It is necessary to take a step back and decide what are the team's primary's objectives for this effort.

### Automation

More automation for the release process is desired for the team to lessen overall
burden of our support role. These are identified areas for automation:

- Release changes approval,
- Components (API, Admin, DD-API, documentation) releases to production,
- Lambdas releases to staging,
- Lambdas releases to production,
- Tests reports are published for the team to see.

### More release autonomy

Delegate release checks to developers in order to remove burden on the ops
lead. By having developers approve and promote their own changes ready for a
production release, this would remove some hurdles.

### Risk management

The releases need to happen with a certain safety of checks, verifications and
certified approvals by the change owners. Human interventions might be required
at certain points to approve of changes or identify issues, potentially
reverting bad rollouts. At the same time, having too many human intervention
will lead to a higher number of mistakes.

There are changes of certain nature such as infrastructure that leads to
disruption of the environment itself and might require isolation in a separate
environment.

### Process alignment

As we rework our release pipeline, it's best to have aligned close to what the
team desires in terms of release process. It's possible that the current
process actually does not satisfy all the check boxes that we would ideally
have. It's important to strike a balance on quality control and a fearless
ability to ship as per the [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) and
[modernised methodologies](https://modernagile.org/).

### Process effort

The team desire less chores for the ops lead and incident commander, to make
room for other tasks that cannot benefit of automation. Complexity of the
effort should be abstracted away.

### Simplicity

The revamp might lead to a more complex process of checks and balance, but we
should make it appear as simple as we can, and simplify further when possible.

### Implementation effort

The organization has finite resources, time and personal. Hence our solution
needs to consider in these factors and appetite for picking the right one.

## Options

This section lists suggestions made by the team with different considerations
and goals. We'll first review the current CI/CD process.

### Current process

### Stronger responsibility for release changes on developers

A lightweight changes that the process can include in the first place is to put
more burden on the developers' shoulders on the changes approval step.
Specifically, whatever the developer pushes to the staging environment is what
will get released by the ops lead.

This keeps the current environments as-is and does not make new automation
additions. This is a status quo for most release di mensions except for the
manual aspect.

#### Pros

- Incremental
- Very cheap to implement
- Lighten load on the ops lead role

#### Cons

- Higher risk factor of deploying to production (as it relies on multiple human interventions)

### Dedicated *experimental* and *dev* environments

Currently the staging environment is used as an integration/development
environment. This has been workng, but is not aligned with best practices, as
it leaves staging in a non-production like state. With the introduction of the
new "Dev" environment, it became possible to add an additional environment
into the process that allows staging to always remain in the same state as
production.

The new "Dev" envorinment as it exists today is not suitable for such a role
because it is constantly being created/destroyed/altered by the Core team in
order to test and develop infrastructure changes. It would not be reliable
enough for the App team to develop against.

An additional environment could be created that is reserved for the App team's
development and integration, and the existing "Dev" environment could be
reclassified as the "Core" environment to identify it as being used by the
Core team for infrastructure development.

![Potential Core and Dev Environment Solution](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cds-snc/notification-adr/main/records/diagrams/2024-01-22.reshaping-cicd-environments/core-dev-env.png?raw=true "Potential Core and Dev Environment Solution")

#### Pros

- Staging could be used to test the actual production release package and the associated process, which is currently not being tested.
- The release process to staging could be automated completely.
- Safety net for automating releases to production. At end of day,
automatically create a release package from Dev, and automatically deploy this
package to staging. Run automated testing overnight. If the tests pass, there
is a high degree of certainty that it will release successfully in production,
and thus does not require intervention from the team/Ops Lead.
- Application development would not be hindered by the Core team's infrastructure changes
- Simplified release process for the ops lead
- Delegate the promotion to production to people working on the task rather
than expecting the ops lead to know it all

#### Cons

- Potentially increased cloud costs, but there are ways to reduce/eliminate this
- Increased complexity for Core team with environment management, can be
abstracted
- Increased complexity for release process, can be abstracated

### Fixed schedule

Inspired from a release train model, the process could automate part of the
release by having a fixed release for its schedule. The main idea is that the
ops lead would be offloaded of its release tasks.

Ideally, there are a few protections we need in place in order for safety
to be maintained. Different variations of this fixed scheduled release can
be considered with different levels of risk, complexity, effort, budget, process alignment and automation.

#### Variation: status quo for staging (as dev) with a fixed scheduled

Our current process and timeline is kept except that the release is automated
with a fixed schedule. This implies that the staging environment is in a
releasable state at the fixed schedule. It is the responsibility of the
developers to make sure that their changes are out of the way if these are not
ready yet, requiring them to revert any change that should not get released by
the end of a working day.

#### Pros

- Automated release
- Less burden on the ops lead to validate a release and to execute on it.
- Relatively low effort to implement compared to solutions with a dedicated
dev environment
- Potential for running all automated tests prior to the fixed schedule

#### Cons

- Increased burden on each developers with extra revert tasks at the end of day
- Increased risk as more independent human intervention is required
- Less flexibility in what's released: it's based on the fixed schedule

#### Variation: experimental / dev / staging environments with a fixed scheduled

This a blend of the fixed release schedule along with the *Dedicated
experimental and dev environments* option. Hence, a separate *dev* environment
exists to host the latest developers' changes. Changes ready to get promoted
for a production release would get merged into the staging environment, most
likely from a `dev` to the `main` VCS branch transition.

Instead of kicking the release process with a manual action, the release would
be done with changes promoted and deemed worthy of production, since these
changes were promoted by task workers independently and quality checks such as
quality assurance, product manager's approval, designer's checks.

#### Pros

- Automated release
- Less burden on the ops lead to validate a release and to execute on it.
- Relatively low effort to implement compared to solutions with a dedicated
dev environment
- Potential for running all automated tests prior to the fixed schedule
- Staging could be used to test the actual production release package and the associated process, which is currently not being tested
- The release process to staging could be automated completely
- Safety net for automating releases to production
- Simplified release process for the ops lead
- Delegate the promotion to production to people working on the task rather
than expecting the ops lead to know it all

#### Cons

- Less flexibility in what's released: it's based on the fixed schedule
- Potentially increased cloud costs, but there are ways to reduce/eliminate this
- Increased complexity for Core team with environment management, can be
abstracted
- Increased complexity for release process, can be abstracated
