# System status

## Status

**DRAFT**

## Context

The system status page will be made up of two sections:
1. The component status section: a quick reference for users to see how well the components of GC Notify are currently operating
2. Incident and service interuptions list: a textual list of current and historical incidents that affect performance, along with a description and impact

## Components to monitor

The status of the following components will be displayed:
- The GC Notify website
- The GC Notify API
- File uploads
- Email sending
- SMS sending

### Component statuses
Each system component can be rated as one of the following statuses:
- Up
- Degraded
- Down

Each component will have its own criteria for determining its status, based on our [SLO](https://notification.canada.ca/service-level-objectives) where possible.

### Proposed component status definitions
| Component   | Status   | Definition                                                                             |

## Monitoring
Each system will need to be monitored every 30s to determine which status it is in.  

## Systems architecture
The website that shows system status needs to be deployed separately from the main GC Notify website so that we can continue showing status information even if the GC Notify website is down.  It should not live within our existing EKS node.

### Front-end
A new front-end website will be deployed to show the status information.  It will be served from a new domain, status.notification.canada.ca

### Back-end
A new back-end API wil be deployed that will be responsible for assessing the status of each component of the system.  

#### Status checks
- The website/API/File upload checks can all be done via simple HTTP requests to the respective systems.  No special permissions or rights are required. 
    - **Question**: Can we leverage [the CDS status page](https://github.com/cds-snc/status-statut) for this?
- For email and SMS, we will need to assess the actual sending time for each priority of each message type (email and SMS).  These checks will require read access to the notify database in order to calculate sending time.
   - The healthcheck lambda should be extended to send a notification of each type and priority, and we can use these to assess the health of the email and sms sending functions.

## Code architecture
In order to maintain good developer experience, reduce code duplication and decrease maintenance, the code for the new site should be co-located in the admin repo. We may be able to use [this poetry plugin](https://pypi.org/project/poetry-multiproject-plugin/) to achieve this.  The new pages would not get deployed with admin, but rather be deployed as their own stand-alone site.

## Designs

### Some systems degraded

## Release model
This feature can be release in 2 phases:
1. The status page with the component status section including only the HTTP status checks + incident and service interuptions list
2. The addition of the email and SMS sending status checks

## Decision

_TODO: Describe the way forward._

## Consequences

_TODO: Describe foreseen and felt consequences of the decision (possible after 1-3 months)._
