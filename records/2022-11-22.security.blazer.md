# Introducing Blazer and its Implementation for Notify

Date: 2022-11-22

## Status

**DRAFT**

## Context
To have a thorough understanding of data in our system, Notify devs wanted a collaborative tool that would allow them to explore the database. The tool would allow us to store queries and share them between developers. A bonus would be if the tool graphed results in a meaningful manner. The goal of this ADR is to explain the implementation of the tool that was chosen for exploring the database.

## Blazer

We decided to use [Blazer](https://github.com/ankane/blazer) as our GUI to connect to the DB. Blazer gives us control by being open source and auditable, it comes with a built-in graphing interface that is helpful to visualize data.

### Implementation

Introducing blazer into our system requires us to do the following:

1. Blazer needs access to the main Notify DB
2. Blazer needs to be secure and auditable

## Deployment

### Blazer Container

#### [Security Assessment of Blazer Docker Container](https://github.com/cds-snc/platform-core-services/issues/155)
The first step to adding Blazer to the Notify VPC required the SRE team to assess the Blazer Docker image. The docker image (v.2.6.5) was assessed for the following:
1. Any malicious code
2. Vulnerabilities with Blazer dependencies
3. Unexpected network traffic

The SRE team found no major concerns with the docker image, but decided to fork the image and add Google Oauth to audit the queries conducted through blazer.

You can read the detailed findings and conclusion through the above link.

### Blazer Image
The SRE team forked and stored the [Blazer Image](https://github.com/cds-snc/notification-lambdas/tree/main/blazer). This way Notify has control over the image that is deployed to our production system. The downside of this is that Notify devs need to maintain this image by pushing security updates. We use this image to ensure we have control over what has access to the Notify system.

The repository where the container is hosted uses **Renovate** to help manage security updates. Upgrading the image with renovate suggestions should be part of the dev sprint process.

### Database
Blazer stores all its queries in a Blazer schema under the database. To have a separation of concerns and not use the same database for both Notify data and Blazer data, a new database - "Database Tools" was set up.

Blazer accesses the Notify DB through a read-only connection string on the replica. This may lead to too many concurrent reads on the DB but should be scalable in the long term by adding further replicas.

### ECS Task
Set up blazer to run as an ECS Task. Blazer runs as a service within an ECS cluster.
This meant we didn't have to deploy a Blazer instance inside the EKS cluster and instead separated the service for its own reliability and security purpose.

### AWS PrivateLink

#### Blazer Threat Modelling Exercise
Blazer ECS task has unrestricted access to egress data to the internet on port 443. Since this task has read-only access to all of Notify's data, this would allow a threat agent to dump and export all our data. There is no monitoring or alerting on unexpected data egress from the Notify VPC. you can read about the entire threat model and the resulting reason to create AWS Private Links [here](https://github.com/cds-snc/platform-core-services/issues/154).

### Solution
We need to introduce [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) for Blazer to speak to all of Notify's and AWS's services without exiting the Notify VPC. Previous to the implementation of PrivateLink, Blazer as well as our EKS cluster, would need to exit the VPC to speak to other AWS cloud services. With the introduction of Blazer, we were adding a further vector that a third party could attack as Blazer would have to access the internet. We introduced PrivateLinks into our infrastructure so services can speak to each other securely without leaving the VPC.

### Google CIDR
An AWS lambda was needed for updating Google CIDR ranges(https://github.com/cds-snc/notification-lambdas/tree/main/google-cidr). The CIDR lambda updates the Google CIDR ranges that are allowed to exit the VPC and needed for Google OAuth to work through the Blazer image.

## Monitoring

### Logs
Blazer logs can be found in Cloudwatch under the blazer log group. They also exist in the *blazer_audits* table in the Database Tools DB.

Use the following query to find the logs under the blazer log group
```json
fields @timestamp, @message
| filter @message like /Audit/
| sort @timestamp desc
| limit 20
```
