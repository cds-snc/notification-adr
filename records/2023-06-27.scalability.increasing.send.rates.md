# Scalability: increasing send rates

Date: 2023-06-27

## Status

**DRAFT**.

## Context

As Notify usage grows (and in particular as we anticipate increasing usage by PTMs) we need to increase our email and sms send rates.

## Options

There are two basic that will need to be increased:
- Notify internals
- AWS send rates

### Notify internals

We currently cannot send emails or sms to AWS fast enough to meet the rates AWS is willing to send. We need to speed up Notify internals. We should identify where the bottlenecks are in the process (for example, which queues are filling up). Then we can remove this bottlenect with a combination of
- improving the code where the bottleneck is
- increasing the hardware used at the bottleneck (more pods / cpu / memory)

### AWS send rates

After Notify can meet our current AWS rates (100 emails per second and 20 sms / second in production) we can have those rates increased
- for email we can make a support request to AWS
- for sms we can procure more long codes, or, preferably, get a short code

## Analysis of Notify internals - email

_TODO: do the analysis

## Analysis of Notify internals - sms

_TODO: do the analysis

## Additional considerations

_TODO: Describe extras in here._

## Decision

_TODO: Describe the way forward._

## Consequences

_TODO: Describe foreseen and felt consequences of the decision (possible after 1-3 months)._
